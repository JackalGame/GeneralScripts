Miscellaneous c# scripts that I have created for various projects

EnviromentSpawner - Instatiates ground prefabs which have varying starting heights to create a smooth multi-height endless runner.

TimeManager - Contains a countdown timer which gradually fades the screen to greyscale before ending the game once timer reaches 0.
